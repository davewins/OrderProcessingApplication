# Application Architecture

This document provides an overview of the architecture of the Order Processing Application, highlighting its key components, integration points, and data flows.

---

## 1. High-Level Overview

The Order Processing Application is a core component within the larger Order Management System. It acts as an integration layer, receiving new order requests, orchestrating data enrichment and persistence, and dispatching notifications based on order status.

    subgraph Order Management System
        A[Order Intake Service] --> B(New Order Queue - TIBCO EMS)
        B --> C{Order Processing App - BWCE}
        C -- Reads/Writes --> D[Order Database]
        C -- Publishes --> E(Order Status Queue - TIBCO EMS)
        E --> F[Fulfillment Service]
        E --> G[Notification Service]
        G --> H(Customer)
    end

    subgraph External Systems
        I[Payment Gateway API]
        J[CRM System]
    end

    C -- Calls --> I
    C -- Reads/Writes --> J

### Part 2: Component Breakdown

Now, here's the second section, detailing the component breakdown within the BusinessWorks application and its corresponding Mermaid diagram:

```markdown
* **Order Intake Service:** A frontend or upstream service that initiates new order requests.
* **New Order Queue (TIBCO EMS):** The primary input channel for the Order Processing Application, ensuring reliable message delivery.
* **Order Processing App (BWCE):** The central BusinessWorks application responsible for the core logic.
* **Order Database:** Persists all order-related transactional data.
* **Order Status Queue (TIBCO EMS):** Publishes updates on order lifecycle stages.
* **Fulfillment Service:** Consumes order status updates to initiate physical fulfillment.
* **Notification Service:** Consumes order status updates to send customer communications.
* **Payment Gateway API:** An external service called for payment processing.
* **CRM System:** Used for customer data lookups (reads) and possibly updates (writes).

## 2. Component Breakdown (Order Processing App - BWCE)

The BusinessWorks application is logically divided into several process modules:

* **`OrderReceiver`:**
    * **Purpose:** Listens on `queue.order.new` for incoming `OrderRequest` messages.
    * **Flow:** Receives message -> Basic validation -> Triggers `OrderProcessor` asynchronously.
* **`OrderProcessor`:**
    * **Purpose:** Orchestrates the main order processing flow.
    * **Flow:**
        1.  Calls `PaymentService` to authorize payment.
        2.  Interacts with `DatabaseService` to save order details.
        3.  Updates order status.
        4.  Publishes order status to `queue.order.status`.
        5.  Calls `CRMService` for customer data updates.
* **`PaymentService`:**
    * **Purpose:** Encapsulates calls to the external Payment Gateway API.
    * **Protocol:** REST/HTTP.
* **`DatabaseService`:**
    * **Purpose:** Handles all interactions with the Order Database.
    * **Operations:** Insert order, update order status, query order details.
    * **Technology:** JDBC (simulated with randomized sleep activities in dev).
* **`CRMService`:**
    * **Purpose:** Manages interactions with the CRM system for customer data.
    * **Protocol:** SOAP/REST (depending on CRM API).

    B --> E[CRMService]

### Part 3: Data Flow, Key Technologies, and Deployment Considerations

Finally, here's the last section of the document:

```markdown
---

## 3. Data Flow

1.  **New Order Request:** JSON message from `Order Intake Service` -> `queue.order.new`.
2.  **Order Processing:** BWCE consumes message, extracts data.
3.  **Payment Authorization:** `OrderProcessor` calls `PaymentService` which translates and calls `Payment Gateway API` (JSON/XML).
4.  **Data Persistence:** `OrderProcessor` calls `DatabaseService` to insert/update records in `Order Database`.
5.  **Status Update:** `OrderProcessor` publishes `OrderStatus` JSON message -> `queue.order.status`.
6.  **CRM Update:** `OrderProcessor` calls `CRMService` to update customer profile (if needed).

---

## 4. Key Technologies

* **TIBCO BusinessWorks Container Edition (BWCE):** Core integration platform.
* **TIBCO Enterprise Message Service (EMS):** Messaging backbone for internal communication.
* **PostgreSQL (Simulated):** Relational database for transactional order data.
* **GitHub:** Source code management.
* **Backstage.io (Developer Hub):** Developer portal for component cataloging and documentation.

<h2>5. Deployment Considerations</h2>

The application is deployed as a Docker container within our Kubernetes cluster. Configuration is managed via environment variables and Kubernetes secrets.

Further details on deployment and operations can be found in the [Troubleshooting Guide](troubleshooting.md).
